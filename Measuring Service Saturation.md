Saturation is a representation of how full your service is, and is one of [[The Four Golden Signals of Monitoring]]. 

When thinking about saturation, it's useful to put the emphasis on the most constrained resource for your application â€“ If memory is our biggest constraint, our dashboards should show our service's memory usage.

Saturation is useful because performance degradation often starts before saturation reaches 100%, so it's important to define a utilization target which you'd like to follow.

Increases in [[Measuring Request Latency]] are frequently leading indicators of high saturation, so it's good to supplement Saturation metrics with high-level latency metrics.

Saturation also cares about things like "your hard drive will be full in 4h". 

It's critical to note that Saturation almost always falls under [[Cause Based Monitoring]], so make sure not to rely on it too hard when setting up [[Alerting]].
