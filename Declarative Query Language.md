Declarative query languages provide ways of querying data from [[Database]]s by describing the data you want to get. On the other hand, in Imperative Query Languages you query data by describing the way you want to fetch the data.

Pros of using declarative query languages are:
- More readable and concise queries
- Query optimizer can optimize the query execution (e.g. automatically use the best indices for the job)
- Further optimizations by database engine are possible in the future without changing the query itself

Cons are that they are less flexible and give less control over execution than imperative query languages.
