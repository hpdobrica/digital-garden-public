soh CAH toa - applies to right triangles


$sin(O)=\frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}$

$cos(O)=\frac{adjecent}{hypotenuse}$

$tan(O)=\frac{opposite}{adjecent}$

reciprocal functions (look at third letter)

$sec(O)=\frac{1}{cos(O)}$

$cosec(O)=\frac{1}{sin(O)}$

$cot(O)=\frac{1}{tan(O)}$






in non right triangles, we have law of sines and law of cosines

law of sines

$\frac{a}{sin(a)} = \frac{b}{sin(b)} = \frac{c}{sin(c)}$

where a is the side length opposite of angle sin(a)

law of cosines

$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos(c)$

if we have two sides and an angle opposite to them, it's possible to have 0,1 or 2 triangles with with same value for sin(a)

sine/cosine transformations

$f(O) = a * sin(b(O-h)) + k$

- a stretches or compresses the graph vertically, affecting the amplitude
- b stretches or compresses the graph horizontally, affecting the period and frequency
- h produces a horizontal shift, also known as a phase shift. 
- k produces a vertical shift, affecting the midline
