Temptation building is a strategy which can be used to increase the attractiveness of a habit by bunding it together with an already-attractive activity. 

For example, if you love watching a TV show, you could only allow yourself to watch it while (or directly after) working out. This creates an incentive to exercise because you want to watch the show.

By bundling attractive and not-so-attractive habits, we can make one depend on the other and ensure that the attractiveness of our target habit increases. This is because the positive emotions associated with the attractive habit spill over to the less attractive habit. By anticipating the reward of attractive activity, you will have dopamine in your blood while performing both the developing habit and desired activity (see [[Public/Dopamine and Desire]]). 

We can use the template to write down our temptation bundling plans:
```
After $NEED_TO_DO, I will $WANT_TO_DO
```
