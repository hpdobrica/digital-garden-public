Recording rules allow us to evaluate and store results of PromQL queries in storage as a new time series, so we don't have to calculate everything on the fly whenever we want to render a graph. They are run on regular intervals to update the resulting time series.

This is especially useful for dashboards, as they re-compute all the queries every time they refresh.
