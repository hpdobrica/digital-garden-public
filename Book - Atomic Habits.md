- 1% improvement goes a long way: moving trajectory of a plane for 2 degrees initially doesn't sound like a lot, but adds over time to bring you far away from initial goals - UK cycling team story  
- goals and systems - what you want and how you are going to achieve it - systems without goals work, not true in opposite direction - score keeps itself you just have to focus on playing well  
- good habits provide latent benefits, not allowing you to see how useful they are upfront  
- bad habits provide latent problems, not allowing you to see how destructive they are upfront

| 341  | ‚ÄúWhen nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it.19 Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it‚Äîbut all that had gone before.‚Äù                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 366  | Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 414  | The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It‚Äôs not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.                                                                                                                    |
| 419  | You do not rise to the level of your goals.

## 2  - How your habits shape your identity (and vice versa)
- three levels of change: outcome process identity  
- people normally start with outcomes, establish processes and works towards changing identity  
- a better way is to establish identity, create processes based on identity (what would a healthy person do), which will lead to outcomes  
- identity emerges out of habits, every action casts a vote for your identity - piling evidence leads to belief in the identity, identity leads to stronger effortless habits  
- habits are not only for getting better results, they are primarily a tool for changing who you are

| Location 496  | The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It‚Äôs one thing to say I‚Äôm the type of person who wants this.

| Location 533  | Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## 3  
- habit is repeated behavior that is automatic, it frees up brain bandwidth to do other things  
- their purpose is to solve problems with as little energy or effort as possible  
- four steps of habit feedback loop: cue, craving, response, reward  
- hear phone buzz, crave to see the notification, unlock phone, craving satisfied and information learned  
- find a blocker at work causing stress, feel the crave to relieve stress, scroll reddit, craving satisfied  
- to change habits:  
- cue - make it obvious  
- craving - make it attractive  
- response - make it easy  
- reward - make it satisfying

| Location 690  | The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Location 715  | Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Location 724  | If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won‚Äôt experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won‚Äôt be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you‚Äôll have no reason to do it again in the future.                                                                                                        |
| Location 734  | In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
  
# Law I: make it obvious  
  
## 4  - The man who didn't look right
  
- practice makes your brain pick up important details and filter out unimportant stuff (face recognizing heart attack, differentiating a rocket from a plane...)  
- habits are automatic so we stop paying attention to them, most of the time we aren't aware of them at all  
- point and call like in Japanese railways to raise awareness and make some processes less automatic - we can use this on bad habits to break a cue by verbalizing what's happening "I'm about to eat this cake even though I'm not hungry which will satisfy my craving but will bring long term health problems"  
- habits are good or bad depending on context. all habits serve a purpose (smoking calms you in a moment, but negatively impacts health - upsides are lower than downsides in the long run = bad habit). habits that cast votes for given identity are usually good and vice versa

## 5  - The best way to start a new habit
  
- it's important to make the cues obvious  
- well defined habits increase the likelihood of them being followed through:  
- bad: i will do 10 pushups when i take a break for luchh  
- good: once i close my laptop for lunch (time), i will do 10 pushups (behavior) next to my table (location)  
- this gives us a formula of implementation intention: `i will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]`  
- habit stacking is a strategy that uses other habits as cues, and is a powerful way to establish new habits next to old ones  
- formula for habit stacking is `After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]`  
- create a list of habits that you already have (things you do every day) and a list of events that happen to you every day (new message, sunrise, sunset, end of song..) and use these as building blocks

## 6  - Motivation is overrated; environment often matters more
  
- changes in context lead to changes in behavior (position of water in a canteen) - the more water there is in a room, the more likely people are to pick water as their drink  
- we can design our environments to strengthen cues (if you want to take vitamins every morning, put them next to your toothbrush)  
- cues are not only triggers themselves, but contexts as well (people are more likely to drink in groups)  
- if two cues are presented together, habit that's easier to do will usually win - when introducing new habits, it's better to do them in a different place (e.g. work on a desk, rest on a sofa, read on a tablet, play on a console...)

## 7 - The  secret to self control

- environments have a very high impact on our habits (heroin addicts in vietnam)
- once a habit is formed, it's never forgotten, receiving a cue for an old habits can trigger the response years after habit is stopped
- willpower is a valid short term strategy to stick to or from habits
- people with strong self control know how to design their lives to avoid bad cues - less exposure == easier handling of the existing exposures - if you are overexposed, effort required grows tremendously
- in the longer term, it's much better to design your environment to remove the cues: put the phone away in another room, move tv out of bedroom, tuck away console after use to make it harder accessible...




# 1st law summary:

Forming good habbits:
1. Make it obvious
1.1 fill out the habits scorecard. write down your current habbits and become aware of them
1.2 use implementation intentions: "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]"
1.3 use habit stacking "after [CURRENT HABIT], i will [NEW HABIT]"
1.4 design your environment - make the cues of good habits obvious

Inverse 1. Make it invisible
i1.1 reduce exposure - remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment.

# 2nd law: make it attractive

## 8 - how to make a habit irresistible

- animals have cues that force them toward some behavior (birds and red dots), and so do humans (high calorie foods)
- if you make the cue exregatted, the craving will be heightened as well - high calorie food creates craving because our ancestors didn't have a steady food supply - today we experience the same thing with fast food even though we don't have the same environment
- dopamine is the engine behind the craving, which is usually much stronger than actually getting the reward. we can ride the craving train to make our habits more attractive
- by bundling attractive and not-so-attractive habits, we can make one depend on the other and ensure that attractiveness of our target habit increases
- temptation bundling: after [habit i need] i will [habit i want]

## 9 - the role of family and friends

- Judit Polgar
- our behavior is to imitate close, many, powerful, we can use this to establish our habits
- close - friends and family, groups with same habits that have something in common with us are very good for keeping habits 
- many - actors lying about size of line, it's more important for us to be accepted in a group than to be right
- powerful - first fit in then stand out, if a behavior is done by a person with a high status, we associate the behavior with having benefits of that status and it becomes desirable

## 10 - How to find and fix the causes of your bad habits

- stop smoking book
- habits fulfil underlying motives, there are multiple ways to fulfill the same motive
- cue -> prediction -> action
- the cause od habits is prediction that precedes it
- craving is a desire to change our internal state
- i have to cook dinner -> i get to cook dinner
- I'm not confined by my wheelchair, I'm liberated by it
- highlight the benefits of hard habits to make them more atteactive
- motivation rituals (something you enjoy right before difficult habit) - putting headphones on gets associated with focus
- you can also train yourself to feel better on cue by replicating a cue before action that feels good

# 3rd law: make it easy

## 11 - Walk slowly, but never backwards

- photography students quantity/quality
- planning is fine and helpful, but it might trap us in feeling like we are making progress while we are not.
- the more we do something, the more automatic the thing becomes (at first you can't play an instrument with a great deal of effort, but later when pathways in the brain have formed, you can do it while maintaining a conversation)
- because of this, it's important to make sure you start repeating your habits asap - the more repetitions, the closer you are to the habit becoming automatic

## 12 - the law of least effort

- Europe developed faster because it's landmass is oriented east west (less change in climate then us and Africa who are north-south oriented, this easier for agriculture)
- we always tend to do the easier thing of the two because it requires less energy
- the idea is to make the right thing as easy to do as possible, so our chances of actually doing it instead of watching tv are increased
- design environments to remove friction (like japanese  companies) for good habits, as well as to increase friction for bad ones
- resetting the room, making sure everything is prepared for your intended action
- unplug tv after use, remove batteries from remote, put tv in a closet - the more friction, the less likely the habit
- remarkably small amount of friction is enough to stop a habit
- how can we design a world where it's easy to do what's right?

## 13 - how to stop procrastinating by using the two minute rule

- rituals that get thing started - taking a cab to the gym every morning - when you get in the cab (ritual), the rest (exercise) comes natural
- some small actions have outsized impact on the outlook of our day
- making a good early decision, will make bigger impact on making a day good than a few bad decisions later on ( binary tree good/bad decisions)
- two minute rule - our new habits should never take more than 2 min to complete (marathon is end goal, running 10k is hard, running 5k is moderate, running 1k is easy, putting your running shoes on is very easy - and this should be your "gateway" habit)
- the idea is to standardize before optimizing, and to master the art of showing up before everything else

# 4th law - make it satisfying

## 15 - the cardinal rule of behavior change

- Pakistan hand washing with good soap - making the habit more pleasurable makes forming it almost automatic - we are more likely to repeat a behavior if the experience is satisfying 
- our environment changed drastically over time but brain did not - we still prefer immediate rewards even though most of important stuff today is delivered as a delayed reward (study now to get a better job at some point maybe)
- bad habits often have immediate rewards but delayed consequences
- cost of good habits is in the present, cost of bad habits is in the future
- immediate rewards == repetition, immediate punishment == avoidance
- add a little bit of instant pleasure to delayed gratification habits, and a bit of pain to instant pleasure habits
- immediate reinforcement is adding a reward at the end of a habit
- e.g. skipping a spending habit can be rewarded by sending the saved amount to a special category for a thing you want
- always incest in short term rewards that reinforce your identity
- this is temporary solution until evidence of new identity overtakes the motivation
- change is easy when it's enjoyable

## 16 - how to stick with good habits every day

- feeling of making progress is an awesome motivator - habit tracking allows us to easily harness this
- on the end of the habit, mark X to state that you performed a habit, over time streak will be a good motivator to continue performing habit on bad days
- don't break the chain, never miss twice
- not everything that can be tracked is a good metric (restaurant tracking revenue which doesn't correctly account for satisfaction)
- be careful about making the measurement the end goal and chasing after a number - if this happens, reevaluate what you track

## 17 - how an accountability partner can change the game

- inversion of 4th law is to make it immediately unsatisfying
- making a president butcher an innocent person before using a nuke would make the decision immediately unsatisfying and would make them reconsider
- seatbelt laws is a form of policy which changed the habits of a lot of people quickly by utilizing punishment for not sticking with it
- we can accomplish the same by making habit contracts which dictate punishment which will be used if habit is not followed
- habit contracts work better if you have someone to hold you accountable
- even having someone doing something with you makes not doing it harder because you are now also breaking a promise to another person, not just yourself

# advanced tactics 

## 18 - the truth about talent (when genes matter and when they don't)

- genes make us good at different things, swimmers would be bad runners and vice versa - if Phelps trained to be a professional runner, he'd be doomed from the start
- our personality traits influence what kinds of habits suit us, we shouldn't take whatever's popular but whatever's the most appealing to us
- if you want to read, don't fret about reading just nonfiction, it's better to read then not to
- there is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and satisfaction
- exploit when winning, explore when losing
- questions:
- what feels like fun to me, but work to others?
- what makes me lose track of time?
- where do i get greater returns than the average person?
- what comes naturally to me?
- Dilbert comic - better than average at drawing and at comedy, but a unique intersection makes it different - either win by being better or by being different

## 19 - the Goldilocks rule: how to stay motivated in life and work

- Goldilocks rule talks about how a thing should be challenging enough but not too challenging in order for us to achieve deep focus doing it
- optimal level of arousal is a midpoint between boredom and anxiety
- greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom - we can't be doing something only when we feel like it and expect exquisite results
- you might not feel like exercising, but you won't regret it
- you need to learn to fall in love with boredom
- seeking novelty is so appealing to us that the moment we have the habit figured out, we start looking for a change, even though the current one is good

## 20 - the downside of creating good habits

- once habit settles in, we are on autopilot and stop paying attention to small errors, our performance slightly drops
- Lakers team and deliberate effort in playing being measured instead of simple results
- habits + deliberate practice = mastery
- reflect on your habits and your identity
- identity needs to be dynamic, we can't cling to it or make it too specific without creating trouble for ourselves in the future

| Location 2138 | People often think it‚Äôs weird to get hyped about reading one page or meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Location 2438 | We all want better lives for our future selves. However, when the moment of decision arrives, instant gratification usually wins. You are no longer making a choice for Future You, who dreams of being fitter or wealthier or happier.19 You are choosing for Present You, who wants to be full, pampered, and entertained. As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.fn3 |
| Location 2517 | Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures‚Äîlike moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles‚Äîprovide clear evidence of your progress. As a result, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Location 2534 | Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Location 2543 | Most of us have a distorted view of our own behavior. We think we act better than we do. Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what‚Äôs really going on each day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Location 2559 | In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don‚Äôt want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Location 3139 | Sustaining an effort is the most important thing for any enterprise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Location 3145 | Top performers in all fields engage in various types of reflection and review, and the process doesn‚Äôt have to be complex. Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge is one of the greatest marathoners of all time and an Olympic gold medalist.6 He still takes notes after every practice in which he reviews his training for the day and searches for areas that can be improved.                                                                                                                 |
| Location 3154 | I know of executives and investors who keep a ‚Äúdecision journal‚Äù in which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the end of each month or year to see where they were correct and where they went wrong.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Location 3186 | The more sacred an idea is to us‚Äîthat is, the more deeply it is tied to our identity‚Äîthe more strongly we will defend it against criticism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Location 3193 | The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Location 3219 | A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Location 3236 | The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent improvement, but a thousand of them. It‚Äôs a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each one a fundamental unit of the overall system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Location 3241 | Each improvement is like adding a grain of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tilting things in your favor. Eventually, if you stick with it, you hit a tipping point. Suddenly, it feels easier to stick with good habits. The weight of the system is working for you rather than against you.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Location 3247 | Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Location 3284 | Awareness comes before desire. A craving is created when you assign meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe your current situation, and that means a craving can only occur after you have noticed an opportunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Location 3287 | Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently. Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Location 3295 | Peace occurs when you don‚Äôt turn your observations into problems. The first step in any behavior is observation. You notice a cue, a bit of information, an event. If you do not desire to act on what you observe, then you are at peace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Location 3323 | Suffering drives progress. The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Location 3341 | ‚ÄúBeing poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.‚Äù                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Location 3361 | New plans offer hope because we don‚Äôt have any experiences to ground our expectations. New strategies seem more appealing than old ones because they can have unbounded hope. As Aristotle noted, ‚ÄúYouth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.‚Äù8 Perhaps this can be revised to ‚ÄúYouth is easily deceived because it only hopes.‚Äù There is no experience to root the expectation in. In the beginning, hope is all you have.                                                    |
