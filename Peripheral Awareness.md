Peripheral Awareness makes sure that while our [[Public/Attention]] is focused on a single thing, we are still generally aware of the things in the background.

Peripheral awareness is more holistic, open and inclusive than [[Public/Attention]]. It provides context for our [[Public/Model of Conscious Experience]], and is more concerned with the relationships between the objects than the objects themselves.
