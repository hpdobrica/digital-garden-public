Atomic Habits is a system for achieving goals by changing our everyday [[Habit]]s in small ways.

It's based on a [[Book - Atomic Habits]] which describes the practical implementation of the system, and talks about what habits are, how they are formed and broken, and how we can utilize this knowledge to help us achieve our goals.

The base idea of the system is that if you find a way to make your behavior 1% better, this 1% will compound over time to provide you with unexpectedly big results. In other words, we shouldn't pay so much attention to the results that we are getting right now. Instead, we should focus on our current trajectory, making sure that it leads us to our goals in the long run.

The book revolves around [[The Four Laws of Behavior Change]], which describe how we can tweak each of the four [[Habit Feedback Loop]] stages, to ensure that our good habits happen more, and that our bad habits happen less.
