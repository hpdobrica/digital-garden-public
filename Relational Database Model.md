Relational [[Database Model]] is an approach to structuring and managing data in [[Database]]s.

Data is stored in **tables** (also called relations) with predefined **schemas** (columns with specific data types). **Foreign keys** define relationships between the tables. 

The stored data is [[Data Normalization|normalized]] to avoid redundancy and ensure consistency when updating data.

Biggest advantage of relational model compared to [[Document Database Model]] is that it provides better support for joins, and many-to-one / many-to-many relationships.
