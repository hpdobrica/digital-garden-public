Database models are different approaches to structuring and managing data in [[Database]]s.

Itâ€™s not possible to say in general which data model leads to simpler application code; it depends on the kinds of relationships that exist between data items:
- If the data in your application has a document-like structure (i.e., a tree of one-to-many relationships, where typically the entire tree is loaded at once), then itâ€™s probably a good idea to use a [[Document Database Model]].
- If your application does use many-to-many relationships, the document model becomes less appealing and [[Relational Database Model]] might be a better fit.
- For highly interconnected data, the document model is awkward, the relational model is acceptable, and [[Graph Database Model]]s are the most natural.
- There are also use-cases like genome sequencing where special implementations are needed (e.g. GenBank)
