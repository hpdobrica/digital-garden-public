Standard deviation describes how values are spread around the [[Mean]]. Low standard deviation means that the values are tightly clustered around mean (think a spiked graph), while high standard deviation means that the values are spread far apart (think more of like a bell curve).

If you have a group of people with the following heights:
- 160
- 170
- 175
- 180
- 201

The [[Mean]] height of the group is `(160+170+175+180+201)/5 = 177.2`
