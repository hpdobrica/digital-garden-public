- [[Social Darwinism]] presents different etnicities of humans on a scale from least evolved to most evolved, most evolved being anglosaxons - everyone else was behind in evolution
- [[Darwinism]] itself presents evolution as less linear - the famous ape-standing-up-into-man image presents a false idea in this regard
- in regards to their common ancestors, all life on earth has evolved the same amount of time - dog, bacteria, human
- 3 ingredients to [[Natural Selection]]
	- variation 
	- the differences are in DNA and are heritable
	- adapting by [[Differential Survival]]
- if there's some variation in the population that is heritable, and if that variation affects how well the organism can survive and reproduce, its possible for traits that are well suited for these causes to persist more into future generations and become more and more common
- social darwinists were mostly a group of sociologists who tried to apply Darwin's theories to how the world should be ordered - how the idea of evolution could explain the social world around them
- "survival of the fittest" was coined by sociologist Herbert Spencer
- spencer observed how people from colonized nations have worse situation in the world and attributed it to darwinism - it must be that wealthy people are wealthy because they are better adapted to their environment - they are more evolved than people who are poor
- the idea was poorly transfered from biology to sociology, probably to justify their inactions by saying that "it's ok because it's how nature works"
- if the government helps the poor, it's interfering with "survival of the fittest"
- take one idea and try to apply it to everything
- this followed into the idea that letting the "inferior" part of the population die out would make the human race "more evolved", completely ignoring the that reducing variation hinders the effects of natural selection
- endangered species are often found to have little gene variations in their gene pools - the less variation you have between species the closer you are to "inbreeding effect" leading to unhealthy population - high-variation population is generally a more healthy population
- from this perspective eugenics makes no sense as by reducing variation you are increasing chances of something going wrong with the entire population (e.g. a disease shows up, the more similar the people are, the less chance is that someone will be resistant to it)
- social darwinism is ascribing cultural difference to biological inferiority
- teaching people to behave differently does not affect their biology - this is more following the Lamarckian evolution, which focuses on the traits obtained during lifetime can be inherited by offsprings
- there are much more genetic variations within "human social races" than there is between the races themselves - from biological standpoint, this is not a valid way to categorize people
