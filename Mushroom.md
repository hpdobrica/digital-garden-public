Mushrooms represent the fruiting bodies of certain types of [[Public/Fungi]] that belong to Basidiomycota phylum. They produce spores, which helps the fungus spread. 

Below the mushroom, inside the soil or some other substrate, a fungus also has a big network of filaments called [[Public/Mycelium]], which is in charge of finding food, growth of the fungus, as well as the production of mushrooms.
