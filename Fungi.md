Fungus (plural Fungi) is any eukaryotic ([[Public/Eukarya - Domain]]) organism that belongs to a group of:
- Yeasts
- Molds
- [[Public/Mushroom]]s

They are specified as a separate [[Public/Kingdom - Taxonomy]] of life, distinct from plants and animals. The main characteristic that sets them apart from other living organisms is that they have chitin in their cell walls.

[[Public/Mycology]] is the study of fungi.
