- philosophy = philosophia = love of wisdom


- [[@Pythagoras]] coined the term
	- lack of hard facts, ton of speeculation
	- belived in reincarnation
	- had followers, mythical figure, self named messiah
	- loved math and astronomy
	- maybe studied in malesian schoold of thought
	- set up a commune in italy (300 members)
		- must have been likable to be able to get the people to change their lives and follow him
		- couldnt eat meat (reincarnation)
			- eating outher animals = eating your grandma that just passed
		- living the life of restriction
	- he was doing it all for the love of wisdom
	- today things are taken for granted, then nobody know about them
	- now pre-algebra class, then godlike knowledge
	- "number is the ruler of all forms"
	- math, music and astronomy - understnding them = understnading universe
	- harmonies = mathematical ratios
		- math explaining music reinforces that math explains everything in the universe
		- the same principle was basis of discovery that chemical elements are arranged by atomic weight
		- this is now known as the Law of Octaves
	- understanding of eternal facts is the closest man can get to being immortal
	- reasons > senses
	- influenced deductive reasoning - parmenides

- [[@Parmenides]]
	- dark cloud of deductive reasoning
	- his ideas destroy other's ideas
	- nothing ever changes, reality is one single unchanging blob
	- "goddess told him"
	- wrote stuff as poems to make it more accessible for people
		- if something exists, it exists
		- if something doesnt exist, it doesnt
		- nothing can exist and not exist at the same time
		- a point of time when a universe was in a state of nothing existing was impossible
		- nothing can come into existence from a place where nothing exists
		- something cannot come from nothing
		- unverse must have always existed, and is eternal
	- he asked a lot of questions like if universe came into existence, what caused it to come into existence? why then oppposed to earlier or later?
	- we cant talk about somethinng that doesnt exist
	- believed to live in a world which is a complete ilusion - change and movement is impossible, so doing anything is absolutelly pointless
	- most of presocratics have in common that they come to a good conclusion, and then try to apply it to absolutely everything they touch (atoms, numbers, reason over senses)
	- his mostimportant idea is that you have to trust the process to arrive at the conslusion, it's not enough to just take whatever "appears to your senses" as the right solution
	- many philosophers that came after him agreed with him on many things, but couldn't swallow the idea of unchangging universe, so they tried to pick his ideas up and explain this part through some other methods

-  Empedocles
	- one of these methods was that everything waas built out of 4 unchaanging elements (earth, fire, air, water) that wen comined create the chaning world we see
	- immortal god guy 
	- if you dont agree with him, you are a fool
	- all men were gods but lost their immortality
	- they could regain their god status by following him around and thinking hard abbout stuff lol
	- believed in reincarnation (pythagorean)
	- two forces
		- love
		- strife (drives elements apart)
	- these two bbattle eachother and that creates change in the universe
	- at the beginning there was only love and the univrser was one sphere of elements
	- strife drove them apart and created universe as we know it
	- first time idea came that there was an intangible force thats influencing the physical elements
	- He had a blend of successful ideas of philosophers who came before him
	- Eventually he jumped into a volcano to prove he was immortal
	- Endorsed by Aristotle, who shared many of his ideas, and whose ideas were considered the truth until the 18th century
