Standard deviation describes how values are spread around the [[Mean]]. Low standard deviation means that the values are tightly clustered around mean (think a spiked graph), while high standard deviation means that the values are spread far apart (think more of like a bell curve).

If you have a group of people with the following heights:
- 160
- 170
- 175
- 180
- 201

The [[Mean]] height of the group is `(160+170+175+180+201)/5 = 177.2`

To calculate standard deviation, we take each height and calculate the sqare of it's difference from the mean:
- `(177.2-160)^2=295.84`
- `(177.2-170)^2=51.84`
- `(177.2-175)^2=4.84`
- `(177.2-180)^2=7.84`
- `(177.2-201)^2=566.44`
