Ascomycota are one of the [[Public/Fungi phylum]] that belong to Dikarya subkingdom, as they have 2 nuclei per cell. They are considered "higher fungi" along with [[Public/Basidiomycota]].

The feature that tells them apart from [[Public/Basidiomycota]] is their [[Public/Hymenium]], which is called Ascocarp. Their [[Public/Mushroom]]s produce sacs of spores called Asci, because of which they are also known as "sac fungi".
