Four laws of behavior change are principles for designing better [[Habit]]s described by [[Atomic Habits]]

Each law of behavior change is tied to one stage of [[Habit Feedback Loop]], telling us how to optimize this part of the habit cycle to reduce the friction and increase the likelihood that a habit will be formed. Following through with all four laws is critical, as a failure at any stage breaks the habit loop. The four stages and their corresponding laws are:
- `Cue` - [[Make it obvious - First law of behavior change]]
- `Craving` - [[Make it attractive - Second law of behavior change]]
- `Response` - [[01 Inbox/Make it easy - Third law of behavior change]]
- `Reward` - [[Make it satisfying - Fourth law of behavior change]]

Each law also has its inverse law, which can be applied to introduce friction into the four stages of undesired habits, helping us break them.
