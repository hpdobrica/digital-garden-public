Errors show us a rate of failed requests, and are one of [[The Four Golden Signals of Monitoring]].  

Error rates can look at requests that failed:
- directly (5XX errors) â€“ fetched at load balancer level is an easy way to track this globally. See [[Where to Collect Metrics#Infrastructure-exported Metrics]]
- indirectly (2XX code but wrong response) â€“ which is hard to track, see [[Where to Collect Metrics#Synthetic Clients]]
- by policy (e.g., any request served over 1s could be treated as an error)
