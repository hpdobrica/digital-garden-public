In statistics, Mean is the thing you normally know as "average".  It's calculated by summing all numbers and then dividing the sum by the number of numbers.

```javascript
// not the actual way to do it, just pointing out the idea
const mean = (arr) => arr.reduce((a,b) => a+b) / arr.length

const x = [1,2,3,4,5]

mean(x) // 3

```
