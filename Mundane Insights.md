Mundane insights are useful insights gained through [[Public/Meditation]] practice which teach us about:
- our own personality
- social interactions
- human behavior
- how everyday world works

Note that while mundane insights are very useful, if they don't impact us or our upderstanding of reality in a profound way, they aren't [[Public/Vipassana]] and thus don't lead directly to [[Awakening]].
