The third of [[The Four Laws of Behavior Change]] is to make executing [[Habit]]s easy. This law focuses on making it as easy as possible to start, and keep doing things that pay off in the long run.

When you start playing a new instrument, even with a huge amount of effort you likely can't make it sound half decent. Over time, the neural pathways in our brain become stronger and the process becomes automatic - you can now likely play well, while maintaining a conversation. 

In order for this to happen, we need to make sure we actually do the things we want to develop into habits. Planning your practice schedule and researching about the new instrument is fine and helpful, but only actually playing will get you somewhere. Because of this, when developing a new habit, it's important for us to start repeating it as much as possible as soon as possible - the more repetitions we put in, the more the process becomes automatic.

The problem with the above is that even though we know what's right, it doesn't guarantee that we will do it - usually, people tend to do what's easy instead ([[The Law of Least Effort]]).

We can utilize this law by implementing the following solutions:
- This is another rule where [[Designing Environments for Habits]] is crucial: remove as much friction as possible from the desired habits in order to make them easier to execute. Ask yourself a question: "How can we design a world where it's easy to do what's right?"
- [[Two Minute Rule]] / gateway habits
