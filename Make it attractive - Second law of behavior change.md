The second of [[Public/The Four Laws of Behavior Change]] is to make [[Public/Habit]]s more attractive. This law focuses on increasing the attractiveness of desired habits to increase the likelihood of them being completed.

We all already have cues that force us toward certain behaviors. For example, high-calorie foods act as a cue that triggers a craving for food. Our ancestors experienced periods of food scarcity, and a high-calorie diet was a very attractive option. Today, even with a surplus of food, we still crave high-calorie foods because of the cues that have been hardwired into our brains.

This is where [[Public/Dopamine and Desire]] come into play. We can harness the power of dopamine to make our habits more attractive.

We can utilize the second law by implementing these solutions:
- [[Public/Temptation Bundling]]
- [[Public/Social Influence]]

In addition to this, it also helps to consider how we think and talk about our habits. If we invest the effort to highlight the benefits of hard habits instead of focusing on the part that makes them hard (I can't eat Nutella vs I want to eat healthier snacks), we have the ability to make the habits feel more attractive - and thus make them easier to execute.
