 Insights gained through [[Meditation]] practice is one of the main things which leads to [[Awakening]].  Insight into the true nature of reality that radically transforms our understanding of ourselves and our relationship to the world is called Vipassana.

In addition to vipassana, meditation also produces many other useful [[Mundane Insights]].

Vipassanas are not intelectual, but deeply intuitive in nature

Five most important Vipassanas are insights into:
- impermanence
- emptiness
- nature of [[Suffering]]
- interdependence
- illusion of separate self
