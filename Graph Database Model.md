Many-to-many relationships are what gives advantage to [[Relational Database Model]] over [[Document Database Model]], but in cases when we have a lot of complex many-to-many relationships, it is good to start thinking about how to model our data as a graph.

Graphs are good for evolvability: as you add features to your application, a graph can easily be extended to accommodate changes in your applicationâ€™s data structures.

There are several similar ways of structuring and querying data in graphs, like Property Graph Model and Triple-Store Model.

## Property Graph Model

implemented by [[Neo4j]], Titan, InfiniteGraph...

You can think of a graph store as consisting of two relational tables, one for vertices and one for edges.

Each vertex is given a symbolic name like USA or Idaho. Other parts of the query can use those names to create edges between the vertices, using an arrow notation: `(Idaho) -[: WITHIN]- > (USA)` creates an edge labeled WITHIN, with Idaho as the tail node and USA as the head node.

## Triple-Store Model

implemented by Datomic, AllegroGraph...

The triple-store model is mostly equivalent to the property graph model, using different words to describe the same ideas. 

The data is stored as tripets containing subject, predicate a
