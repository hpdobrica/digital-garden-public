To completely delete a commit from a [[Git]] branch you can use the following command:

```bash

# on linux
git rebase --rebase-merges --onto $1^ $1

# on osx
git rebase --rebase-merges --onto $1~ $1


```

The `$1` in the above command would be the commit sha of the commit you want to remove. Packing this into a zfunc named `git-cherry-pit`, you'd use it like so:

```bash

git-cherry-pit 8b5515fdf49feea83ad6fe9c0ad4a9e81abe9f86

```
