Basidiomycota are one of the [[Public/Fungi phylum]] ([[Public/Phylum - Taxonomy]]) that belong to Dikarya subkingdom, as they have 2 nuclei per cell. They are considered "higher fungi" along with [[Public/Ascomycota]].

The feature that tells them apart from [[Public/Ascomycota]] is their [[Public/Hymenium]], which is called Basidiocarp. Their [[Public/Mushroom]]s produce club-like structures called Basidia, because of which they are also known as "club fungi".

Basidiomycota has 3 subphyla, each with numerous classes:
- Ustilaginomycotina
- Pucciniomycotina
- [[Public/Agaricomycotina]]
