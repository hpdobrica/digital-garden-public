[[Kubernetes]] Master nodes (also known as k8s controlplane) are [[K8S Node]]s responsible for managing the cluster. No user processes normally run on master node, this is the job of the [[K8S Worker Node]]s.

These are the main components of the k8s controlplane:
- [[etcd cluster]]
- [[K8S Scheduler]]
- [[K8S Controller Manager]] 
- [[K8S Apiserver]]
