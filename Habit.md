A habit is a behavior that is performed regularly or even automatically. 

Our brain evolved to "implement" habits to reduce the cognitive load of problems that arise over and over in your environment. You can think of them as quick and reliable solutions to recurring problems.

Habits are formed and maintained via the [[Habit Feedback Loop]].
