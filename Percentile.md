In statistics, `n-th` percentile represents the value below which `n%` records can be found. It's calculated by sorting a data set and dividing it into 100 equal groups, and then dividing the same data set into two parts where the lower part contains `n%` of the data, and the higher part contains the rest.

50th percentile of a data set is equal to its [[Public/Median]].

For example, if we talk about [[Public/Measuring Request Latency]], 95th percentile is the time in which 95% of all the requests will be completed.

Looking at the 99th percentile will give us a time in which all of our requests would be completed, excluding the slowest 1%.
