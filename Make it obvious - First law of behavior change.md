First law of behavior change is to make cues to your desired habits more obvious.

Every [[Habit]] starts with a cue (see [[Habit Feedback Loop]]), so in order to ensure we have control over our habits, it's essential that we raise awareness about our cues and gain some control over them.

The process of behavior change needs to start with awareness of our current habits. While it may appear that the urge to act comes out of nowhere, every habit always starts with a cue. A good first step on the journey is to try writing down your current positive and negative habits, and analyzing them to identify their cues.

*Note that positive and negative in terms of habits is dependent on the context - smoking is positive in that it calms your nerves, but has negative effect on your health. Exercise might be temporarily unpleasant, but has a positive long term impact. Seeing how [[Continuous Improvement]] has a direction you are heading at its core - we can agree to say that positive habits are generally the ones that bring us benefits in the long term.*

Let's take one positive and one negative habit as an example:

Let's use taking supplements as a positive habit. A cue for this habit might be randomly remembering or seeing the bottle with supplements. Negative habit can be scrolling the social media, cue here being a chain of boredom/anxiety, phone in hand, seeing the Reddit app icon.

Now that we are aware of these habits, and of our desire to take supplements more regularly and scroll less on social media, we can start using the first law to help us achieve it.

## Designing our environment

We could make tremendous improvements on both of these habits by sheer force of will. Let's say we get really motivated to do so: we keep taking supplements every day, and keep ourselves off of social media.

"Just do it" - motivation is a fine approach for a time, but it's hugely overrated when it comes to forming and keeping habits. The reason for this is that habits need to be consistent, while motivation in it's nature is not.

A far better approach to making sure we take supplements every day would be to place them next to (or even on top of) our phone on the bed table alongside a bottle of water. By doing so, we have designed our environment to work in favor of our habits - we have strengthened the cues for taking the supplements, making sure we don't rely on sheer luck and memory in order to take them.

We can apply a similar strategy for mindlessly scrolling social media. It's kinda hard to wish boredom or anxiety away, but it's not so hard to put your phone in another room while trying to focus, and/or remove the social media icon from your home screen. By doing so, we have by no means disabled ourselves from exercising our bad habit, but we have made it significantly harder to do so. Habits form because they are easy, canned responses to specific situations. Next time that anxiety hits, instead of (probably without any awareness) reaching out for your phone, opening reddit and starting to scroll, you now have a lot of friction before this can happen - go to another room, take phone, search for reddit and open it. Try doing that without becoming aware of it!
