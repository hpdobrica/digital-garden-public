While our local network hosts can be referenced with names such as `db`, on the internet, hosts use a special Domain Name format: `www.google.com`.

The purpose of this format is to group similar things together. The last portion of the domain (`.com`) is called the top-level domain. `google` is the domain name, while `www` is the subdomain - of which google has many (`maps`, `workspace`, `photos`).

When you try to reach `maps.google.com`, the process by which you get an actual IP address that corresponds to this domain is called [[DNS Resolution]].
