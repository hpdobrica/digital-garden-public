## 1  
- 1% improvement goes a long way: moving trajectory of a plane for 2 degrees initially doesn't sound like a lot, but adds over time to bring you far away from initial goals - UK cycling team story  
- goals and systems - what you want and how you are going to achieve it - systems without goals work, not true in opposite direction - score keeps itself you just have to focus on playing well  
- good habits provide latent benefits, not allowing you to see how useful they are upfront  
- bad habits provide latent problems, not allowing you to see how destructive they are upfront  
  
## 2  
- three levels of change: outcome process identity  
- people normally start with outcomes, establish processes and works towards changing identity  
- a better way is to establish identity, create processes based on identity (what would a healthy person do), which will lead to outcomes  
- identity emerges out of habits, every action casts a vote for your identity - piling evidence leads to belief in the identity, identity leads to stronger effortless habits  
- habits are not only for getting better results, they are primarily a tool for changing who you are  
  
  
## 3  
- habit is repeated behavior that is automatic, it frees up brain bandwidth to do other things  
- their purpose is to solve problems with as little energy or effort as possible  
- four steps of habit feedback loop: cue, craving, response, reward  
- hear phone buzz, crave to see the notification, unlock phone, craving satisfied and information learned  
- find a blocker at work causing stress, feel the crave to relieve stress, scroll reddit, craving satisfied  
- to change habits:  
- cue - make it obvious  
- craving - make it attractive  
- response - make it easy  
- reward - make it satisfying  
  
# Law I: make it obvious  
  
## 4  
  
- practice makes your brain pick up important details and filter out unimportant stuff (face recognizing heart attack, differentiating a rocket from a plane...)  
- habits are automatic so we stop paying attention to them, most of the time we aren't aware of them at all  
- point and call like in Japanese railways to raise awareness and make some processes less automatic - we can use this on bad habits to break a cue by verbalizing what's happening "I'm about to eat this cake even though I'm not hungry which will satisfy my craving but will bring long term health problems"  
- habits are good or bad depending on context. all habits serve a purpose (smoking calms you in a moment, but negatively impacts health - upsides are lower than downsides in the long run = bad habit). habits that cast votes for given identity are usually good and vice versa

## 5  
  
- it's important to make the cues obvious  
- well defined habits increase the likelihood of them being followed through:  
- bad: i will do 10 pushups when i take a break for luchh  
- good: once i close my laptop for lunch (time), i will do 10 pushups (behavior) next to my table (location)  
- this gives us a formula of implementation intention: `i will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]`  
- habit stacking is a strategy that uses other habits as cues, and is a powerful way to establish new habits next to old ones  
- formula for habit stacking is `After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]`  
- create a list of habits that you already have (things you do every day) and a list of events that happen to you every day (new message, sunrise, sunset, end of song..) and use these as building blocks  
  
## 6  
  
- changes in context lead to changes in behavior (position of water in a canteen) - the more water there is in a room, the more likely people are to pick water as their drink  
- we can design our environments to strengthen cues (if you want to take vitamins every morning, put them next to your toothbrush)  
- cues are not only triggers themselves, but contexts as well (people are more likely to drink in groups)  
- if two cues are presented together, habit that's easier to do will usually win - when introducing new habits, it's better to do them in a different place (e.g. work on a desk, rest on a sofa, read on a tablet, play on a console...)

## 7

- environments have a very high impact on our habits (heroin addicts in vietnam)
- once a habit is formed, it's never forgotten, receiving a cue for an old habits can trigger the response years after habit is stopped
- willpower is a valid short term strategy to stick to or from habits
- people with strong self control know how to design their lives to avoid bad cues - less exposure == easier handling of the existing exposures - if you are overexposed, effort required grows tremendously
- in the longer term, it's much better to design your environment to remove the cues: put the phone away in another room, move tv out of bedroom, tuck away console after use to make it harder accessible...

# 1st law summary:

Forming good habbits:
1. Make it obvious
1.1 fill out the habits scorecard. write down your current habbits and become aware of them
1.2 use implementation intentions: "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]"
1.3 use habit stacking "after [CURRENT HABIT], i will [NEW HABIT]"
1.4 design your environment - make the cues of good habits obvious

Inverse 1. Make it invisible
i1.1 reduce exposure - remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment.

# 2nd law: make it attractive

## 8

- animals have cues that force them toward some behavior (birds and red dots), and so do humans (high calorie foods)
- if you make the cue exregatted, the craving will be heightened as well - high calorie food creates craving because our ancestors didn't have a steady food supply - today we experience the same thing with fast food even though we don't have the same environment
- dopamine is the engine behind the craving, which is usually much stronger than actually getting the reward. we can ride the craving train to make our habits more attractive
- by bundling attractive and not-so-attractive habits, we can make one depend on the other and ensure that attractiveness of our target habit increases
- temptation bundling: after [habit i need] i will [habit i want]

## 9

- Judit Polgar
- our behavior is to imitate close, many, powerful, we can use this to establish our habits
- close - friends and family, groups with same habits that have something in common with us are very good for keeping habits 
- many - actors lying about size of line, it's more important for us to be accepted in a group than to be right
- powerful - first fit in then stand out, if a behavior is done by a person with a high status, we associate the behavior with having benefits of that status and it becomes desirable

## 10

- stop smoking book
- habits fulfil underlying motives, there are multiple ways to fulfill the same motive
- cue -> prediction -> action
- the cause od habits is prediction that precedes it
- craving is a desire to change our internal state
- i have to cook dinner -> i get to cook dinner
- I'm not confined by my wheelchair, I'm liberated by it
- highlight the benefits of hard habits to make them more atteactive
- motivation rituals (something you enjoy right before difficult habit) - putting headphones on gets associated with focus
- you can also train yourself to feel better on cue by replicating a cue before action that feels good 

# 3rd law: make it easy

## 11

- photography students quantity/quality
- planning is fine and helpful, but it might trap us in feeling like we are making progress while we are not.
- the more we do something, the more automatic the thing becomes (at first you can't play an instrument with a great deal of effort, but later when pathways in the brain have formed, you can do it while maintaining a conversation)
- because of this, it's important to make sure you start repeating your habits asap - the more repetitions, the closer you are to the habit becoming automatic

## 12 - the law of least effort

- Europe developed faster because it's landmass is oriented east west (less change in climate then us and Africa who are north-south oriented, this easier for agriculture)
- we always tend to do the easier thing of the two because it requires less energy
- the idea is to make the right thing as easy to do as possible, so our chances of actually doing it instead of watching tv are increased
- design environments to remove friction (like japanese  companies) for good habits, as well as to increase friction for bad ones
- resetting the room, making sure everything is prepared for your intended action
- unplug tv after use, remove batteries from remote, put tv in a closet - the more friction, the less likely the habit
- remarkably small amount of friction is enough to stop a habit
- how can we design a world where it's easy to do what's right?

## 13 - how to stop procrastinating by using the two minute rule

- rituals that get thing started - taking a cab to the gym every morning - when you get in the cab (ritual), the rest (exercise) comes natural
- some small actions have outsized impact on the outlook of our day
- making a good early decision, will make bigger impact on making a day good than a few bad decisions later on ( binary tree good/bad decisions)
- two minute rule - our new habits should never take more than 2 min to complete (marathon is end goal, running 10k is hard, running 5k is moderate, running 1k is easy, putting your running shoes on is very easy - and this should be your "gateway" habit)
- the idea is to standardize before optimizing, and to master the art of showing up before everything else

## 14 - making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible

- guy that dumped all his clothes so he would stay home and write a book 
- inversion of the third law: make it difficult
- commitment device - tying yourself to a ship to hear the sirens without crashing
- timed power socket that turns out internet, boxing half a meal in the restaurant, leaving wallet at home when going out, scheduling a yoga class and paying it upfront - all of these make it easier to do the right thing as the wrong thing is harder to do
- cash register story - one off actions that keep bringing value over time
- block social media, reset passwords if needed
- use technology and automation to free time for the unautomatable

# 4th law - make it satisfying

## 15 - the cardinal rule of behavior change

- Pakistan hand washing with good soap - making the habit more pleasurable makes forming it almost automatic - we are more likely to repeat a behavior if the experience is satisfying 
- our environment changed drastically over time but brain did not - we still prefer immediate rewards even though most of important stuff today is delivered as a delayed reward (study now to get a better job at some point maybe)
- bad habits often have immediate rewards but delayed consequences
- cost of good habits is in the present, cost of bad habits is in the future
- immediate rewards==repetition, immediate punishment==avoidance
- add a little bit of instant pleasure to delayed gratification habits, and a bit of pain to instant pleasure habits
- immediate reinforcement is adding a reward at the end of a habit
- e.g. skipping a spending habit can be rewarded by sending the saved amount to a special category for a thing you want
- always incest in short term rewards that reinforce your identity
- this is temporary solution until evidence of new identity overtakes the motivation
- change is easy when it's enjoyable

## 16 - how to stick with good habits every day

- feeling of making progress is an awesome motivator - habit tracking allows us to easily harness this
- on the end of the habit, mark X to state that you performed a habit, over time streak will be a good motivator to continue performing habit on bad days
- don't break the chain, never miss twice
- not everything that can be tracked is a good metric (restaurant tracking revenue which doesn't correctly account for satisfaction)
- be careful about making the measurement the end goal and chasing after a number - if this happens, reevaluate what you track

## 17 - how an accountability partner can change the game

- inversion of 4th law is to make it immediately unsatisfying
- making a president butcher an innocent person before using a nuke would make the decision immediately unsatisfying and would make them reconsider
- seatbelt laws is a form of policy which changed the habits of a lot of people quickly by utilizing punishment for not sticking with it
- we can accomplish the same by making habit contracts which dictate punishment which will be used if habit is not followed
- habit contracts work better if you have someone to hold you accountable
- even having someone doing something with you makes not doing it harder because you are now also breaking a promise to another person, not just yourself

# advanced tactics 

## 18 - the truth about talent (when genes matter and when they don't)

- genes make us good at different things, swimmers would be bad runners and vice versa - if Phelps trained to be a professional runner, he'd be doomed from the start
- our personality traits influence what kinds of habits suit us, we shouldn't take whatever's popular but whatever's the most appealing to us
- if you want to read, don't fret about reading just nonfiction, it's better to read then not to
- there is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and satisfaction
- exploit when winning, explore when losing
- questions:
- what feels like fun to me, but work to others?
- what makes me lose track of time?
- where do i get greater returns than the average person?
- what comes naturally to me?
- Dilbert comic - better than average at drawing and at comedy, but a unique intersection makes it different - either win by being better or by being different

## 19 - the Goldilocks rule: how to stay motivated in life and work

- Goldilocks rule talks about how a thing should be challenging enough but not too challenging in order for us to achieve deep focus doing it
- optimal level of arousal is a midpoint between boredom and anxiety
- greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom - we can't be doing something only when we feel like it and expect exquisite results
- you might not feel like exercising, but you won't regret it
- you need to learn to fall in love with boredom
- seeking novelty is so appealing to us that the moment we have the habit figured out, we start looking for a change, even though the current one is good

## 20 - the downside of creating good habits

- once habit settles in, we are on autopilot and stop paying attention to small errors, our performance slightly drops
- Lakers team and deliberate effort in playing being measured instead of simple results
- habits + deliberate practice = mastery
- reflect on your habits and your identity
- identity needs to be dynamic, we can't cling to it or make it too specific without creating trouble for ourselves in the future
