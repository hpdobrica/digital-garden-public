Profiling is a type of [[Public/Monitoring]] where we collect a lot of data for a short period of time, which we can use to debug an issue.

Profiling allows us to have **all the events** with **most of the context** for a **limited period of time**. It can generate a ridiculous amount of data so we only want to run it for a short amount of time to help us with a concrete issue.

tcpdump is a good example of profiling tool - you can turn it on to record network traffic based on a filter, but you can't just leave it on permanently, as you will run out of disk space pretty soon.
