On the top of the [[Mushroom]] is the [[Cap (Pileus)]]

On the underside of the cap, there are [[Gills (Lamellae)]].

In some mushrooms, gills are the place where **Spores** are produced. 

There are also some mushrooms which produce spores in other places. Generally, tissue that produces spores, wherever it's located, is called **Hymenium**.

Cap is placed on top of a **Stalk (Stipe)**.

At the base of the mushroom, there is a white cup called **Volva (universal veil)**. It holds the whole fruiting body before the mushroom becomes mature and sprouts.

The ring located below the cap and gills is called **Annulus (partial veil)**. Its used to cover the hymenium until the fruiting body matures.
