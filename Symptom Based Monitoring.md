Symptom Based [[Monitoring]] points us to allows us to observe the user experience. A metric is Symptom based if it shows an actual symptom that is making our users happy or sad. We gather Symptom based metrics almost exclusively through [[Black Box Monitoring]]. Some examples of Symptom Metrics are:
- Error rate
- Request latency

Since these metrics directly represent user's experience, they are a perfect match to be our [[SLI]]s and to implement [[Alerting]] on. See [[What should i be Alerting on]].
