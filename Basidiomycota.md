Basidiomycota are one of the [[Fungi phylum]] ([[Phylum - Taxonomy]]) that belong to Dikarya subkingdom, as they have 2 nuclei per cell. They are considered "higher fungi" along with [[Ascomycota]].

The feature that tells them apart from [[Ascomycota]] is their [[Hymenium]], which is called Basidiocarp. Their [[Mushroom]]s produce club-like structures called Basidia, because of which they are also known as "club fungi".

Basidiomycota has 3 subphyla, each with numerous classes:
- Ustilaginomycotina
- Pucciniomycotina
- Agaricomycotina
