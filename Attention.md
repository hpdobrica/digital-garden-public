Whenever Attention is focused on some object, that object dominates our [[Public/Consciousness]].

Attention singles out a small part of the field of [[Public/Consciousness]], and deeply analyzes and interprets it.

Together with [[Public/Peripheral Awareness]], Attention works to form the [[Public/Model of Conscious Experience]].
