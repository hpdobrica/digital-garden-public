A scalable system is a system that can deal with increasing growth (of data, traffic, complexity) in a reasonable ways.

We can never just say that a system is or isn't scalable. The right way to think about scalability is in terms of questions like "if a system grows in this particular way, what are our options for dealing with that growth?"

Before thinking of how to scale, we must first understand system's load paramters that allow us to quantify the load - requests per second, read/write ratio, number of active users, cache hit rate, distribution of followers per user (e.g. twitter).

Once we know what the load on our system is, we can start thinking about what happens when that load increases and our resources stay the same. How does this affect performance of our system? With a given load increase, how much do we need to bump up resources in order for performance to stay unchanged?

Another question that this raises is how do we define and measure performance? Depending on the type of the system, we might care more about throughput (asynchronous job processing), or about  [[Measuring Request Latency|Request Latency]] (online services).
