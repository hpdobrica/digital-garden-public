Ascomycota are one of the [[Fungi phyla]] that belong to Dikarya subkingdom, as they have 2 nuclei per cell. They are considered "higher fungi" along with [[Basidiomycota]].

The feature that tells them apart from [[Basidiomycota]] is their [[Hymenium]], which is called Ascocarp. Their [[Mushroom]]s produce sacs of spores called Asci, because of which they are also known as "sac fungi".
