When deciding the level of availability we want for our services, the target that we want to achieve is often described as a percentage of time the service is available.

This number is famous as a "number of nines". A system that's 99% available is said to have "two nines" service availability target, while 99.999% available system has "five nines".

The table below represents availability targets, together with how much downtime they allow per year/quarter/month/week/day:


| Availability 	| Year   	| Quarter 	| Month 	| Week  	| Day   	|
|--------------	|--------	|---------	|-------	|-------	|-------	|

| 95%          	| 18.25d 	| 4.5d    	| 1.5d  	| 8.4h  	| 1.2h  	|
| 99%          	| 3.65d  	| 21.6h   	| 7.2h  	| 1.68h 	| 14.4m 	|
