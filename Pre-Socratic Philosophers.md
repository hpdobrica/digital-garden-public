Pre-Socratics are philosophers who developed original schools of thought and predated [[@Socrates]]. 

It's important to note that division to before and after Socrates comes not as much from the importance of Socrates' ideas, as from the fact that [[Public/Philosophy]] was "brought to the masses" by him. Before Socrates, Philosophy was reserved for the rich and the elite - he has brought it into the life of a everyday man.
