A habit is a behavior that is performed regularly, sometimes automatically, often unconciously. 

Our brain evolved to "implement" habits to reduce the cognitive load of problems that arise over and over in your environment. You can think of them as quick and reliable solutions to recurring problems.

Habits are formed and maintained via the [[Habit Feedback Loop]]. 

Our habits determine our outcomes. Even though they seem like a small part of our lives, especially when considering some big goals we have, habits set a trajectory in which you move - moving a meter forward is better than moving 100 meters backwards or not moving at all. See [[Kaizen]].
