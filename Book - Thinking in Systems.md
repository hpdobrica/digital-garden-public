# I - System structure and behavior
## 1 - The Basics

- what makes the slinky bounce? it's not the hand, the hand just releases a latent behavior
- a system is a set of things that are connected which start producing their own patterns of behavior over time
- system responds to the outside forces in a way which is characteristic for itself
- system to a large extent causes a behavior - same external factors appillied to other systems produce different results
- we have intuitive understanding of systems but we take them for granted, often thinking that external factors are causes of problems
- many concepts in system theory pull from intuitive public knowledge, and lessons from system theory often have pretty similar people-sayings i.e. one stitch saves nine, don't put all eggs in one basket
- many solutions to external problems have been solved by looking outside, but some issues eg poverty hunger war keep being unsolved because they are systems problems, they come from inside, and can only be handled by intuitively understanding the system and restructuring it
- systems thinking is not better than reductionist thinking, it's complementary as it gives you a fuller picture (microscope+eye+telescope)
- you can't know behavior of systems just by knowing the parts that make them up
- interconnections hold system's elements together. In most systems, they operate through flow of information, or physical flow in some systems (e.g. flow of water through roots in a tree)
- some flows are easier to see (flow of students through university), while some are harder (informal information and communication between students that makes them take classes that are easier to pass)
- in addition to interconnections, each system has a function or a purpose - which is only legitimately communicated through behavior of a system (e.g. a government might say it cares about pollution, but dedicate little resources to solving that problem, showing that it's obviously not it's purpose, even though they explicitly say it is)
- function is usually used for non-human systems, and purpose for human ones
- important function of every system is to ensure its own perpetuation
- systems have subsystems with their own subpurposes
- purposes don't have to be desired or intentional, but they can arise out of purposes of smaller components of a system - no one wants drug addicted crime ridden society, but some people are desperate for psychological relief, some want to earn money, pushers are less bound by law then police, governments make substances illegal and use force, people more interested in protecting themselves then in recovery of addicts
- keeping subpurposes and purposes in harmony is a property of most successful systems
- bases on above, we can say that systems consist of their elements, interconnections and purposes
- change in purpose has the biggest impact, while changing elements mostly has no impact on the system
- stock of a system represents it's elements that can be counted or measured: water in a bathtub, population of a country, books in a bookstore, hope that world can be a better place...
- flows are processes through which stock changes over time: flowing and draining, births and deaths...
- underground mineral deposit is a stock, out of which comes a flow of minerals into another system. minerals also flow in, but it takes a ridiculously long time
- example of multiple flows affecting a stock is that water reservoir has inflow of water through rain and river, and outflow through evaporation and discharge
- dynamic equilibrium is when the stock doesn't change, but flows continually bring stock up and reduce it in the same amounts - you can stop the water level going down in a bathtub by both closing the sink and by opening the faucet
- human mind finds it easier to notice stocks than flows, and easier to notice inflows than outflows
	- it's more intuitive that you can make oli last longer by finding a new deposit, than it is that you can do it by burning less oil
	- company can raise number of employees by either hiring more or increasing retention of existing employees - two strategies with a vastly different costs
- stocks take time to change because flows take time to flow
	- this is why stocks can act as delays, buffers and shock absorbers in a system
	- even if government has a lot of money, it can't make hundreds of factories overnight - it takes time to accumulate the amount of factories that burn fossil fuels
	- when government decides to switch to a more sustainable fuel, it can't make the change in all factories at once 
	- once the change is made, the amount of CO2 will fall and ozone layer will repair, but it took decades to get this bad, and it will take decades to get better
- these time lags can cause problems, but can also be a source of stability in a system
- being aware of rate of stock change can help you not give up too soon, give you room for experimentation, give you a chance to use opportunities presented by systems momentum 
- stocks decouple inflows and outflows and allow them to be out of balance
- feedback loops
	- systems thinkers see the world as a collection of stocks and mechanisms for regulating stocks by manipulating their flows - in other words, collection of feedback processes 
	- if you see a pattern in stock (growing, shrinking, staying the same) that is consistent over time, there is likely a mechanism creating this consistent behavior
	- these mechanisms operate through feedback loops
	- first hint of existence of feedback loops is having consistent behaviors over long periods of time
	- feedback loop is formed when changes in a stock affect the flows of a stock
		- simplest one being interest rate for savings, the more money you have in account, the bigger the inflow because it's based on percentage
		- another one is when a person sees a low balance of money and decides to work longer hours to increase its inflows
			- if there is a lot of money in your account, you might feel a need to work less and earn less
			- these kind of feedback loops are in place to keep the stock of money inside your account in levels that are acceptable to you
		- again it's important to remember that modifying inflows is not the only way to change your stock of cash, same can be achieved through outflows, by changing how much you spend
	- not all systems need to have feedback loops, but ones that do are common, elegant and surprising
		- for example, stock that changes flows based on outside factors that don't depend on their stock are not feedback loops 
	- stabilizing loops - balancing feedback
		- example of person earning more or less to keep their bank balance in desired levels is a balancing, goal-seeking feedback loop
		- another example is drinking more coffee to raise energy, and taking less once you are full 
		- these feedback loops operate in both directions to keep stock in desired balance
		- another example is cup of coffee cooling (or heating up if iced) to match room temperature - it seeks balance
		- these feedback loops offer stability and resistance to change to the system
		- feedback loops don't need to be effective
			- the signal might be too weak, unclear, incomplete, arrive at the wrong place or wrong time
			- in this case the goal of the feedback loop will never be reached by the stock
	- runaway loops - reinforcing feedback
		- reinforcing feedback loops are amplifying, self multiplying and keep pushing in one direction, whether it's bad or good for the system 
		- they enhance whatever direction of change is imposed on the system
		- examples
			- the more prices go up, the more wages need to go up to maintain the standard of living - the more wages go up, the more prices go up to maintain profitability, which in turn makes the prices go up again 
			- the more soil erodes, the less plants can grow, and the more soil is eroded because there is less roots
			- the more you practice an instrument, the more pleasure you get from the sound, making you spend more time playing and getting more practice
		- these loops happen where a system element is able to reproduce itself or grow as a constant fraction of itself
		- being self enhancing means that they lead to exponential growth or runaway collapses over time
	- the more you think about which decisions are not impacted by feedback loops (decisions made without regard for the stock of the system), the more you will see feedback loops popping up all around you
	- math time: the time it takes for exponentially growing stock to double in size is approximately `70/growth rate`
		- $100 with 7% interest per year will double the money in 10 years (70/7=10)
	- if you hear that population growth causes poverty, is it possible that poverty also causes population growth? if A causes B, is it possible that B also causes A?
	- system thinking shifts the question from who's to blame to what's the system, as feedbacks open up the opportunity for systems to cause their own behavior
	- examples above are limited to one kind of feedback loop at a time - this is rarely the case in reality as loops are often linked together in complex patterns pulling the stock in several directions - a single flow may be modified by a content of 20 stocks
		- because of this, complex systems tend to do much more than stay steady, explode exponentially or self-correct smoothly

### 2 - a brief visit to the system zoo

- systems zoo is similar to normal zoo, we look at categorized, isolated systems and describe them to better understand their behavior and some of the mechanisms that make them tick, while acknowledging that they are still isolated from their normal environment where they would have many complex interactions
- for now we care about systems on their own, and ignore ecosystems
- there is a separate set of books describing different systems in this manner
- one-stock systems
	- one stock - two balancing loops
		- example of this is thermostat controlling heating system
			- based on thermostat setting, we have a balancing loop that adds heat if there is discrepancy between desired and actual room temperature (heat from furnace flows in)
			- based on outside temperature, we have a balancing loop which removes heat to the outside based on discrepancy between room temperature and outside temperature
		- important thing to notice is that changing the desired temperature doesn't instantly work, there is a period where we asked for a bigger temperature, but the temperature is still falling down until the furnace heats up
			- another example of this is a shop having to order stuff up front before they run out, or they won't have stuff to sell because of the delay
		- this gives us two behaviors, one general and one specific to thermostat
			- general: the information delivered by feedback loop can only affect future behavior, it can't have fast enough impact to correct the behavior that drove the current feedback
				- decision maker in the system that is making decision based on feedback can't change the behavior that drove the current feedback, the decision made can only affect the future behavior
				- this means that there will always be delay in responding - this is because flow can't directly react to a flow, it can only react to change in the stock, and only after a slight delay it takes to register the incoming information
				- this difference in time is a reason many economies don't behave like economic models that try to predict them
			- specific: in thermostat like systems you must remember whatever draining/filling processes are going on:
				- if you want to keep temperature at 25, you need to set it above 25 to account for the cooling until heating kicks in
				- if you are hiring to hit the target, you need to hire more to account for people who leave while you are hiring
				- 
		- keep in mind that every balancing loop has its breakdown point, where other loops pull the stock away from its goal more strongly than it can pull back (e.g. too low power furnace and too cold outside)
	- one stock - one reinforcing and one balancing loop
		- example of this is population and industrial economy - applies to any living population and any economy
		- reinforcing loop causes population to rise through birth rate, and a balancing loop causes it to die off through death rate ![Reinforcing and balancing loops acting on population](stock-reinforcing-balancing.png)
		- if fertility and mortality rate are constant
