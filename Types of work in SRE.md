Work performed by [[SRE]] teams can be divided into a few types:
- Engineering work
- Overhead
- [[Toil]]


### Engineering work

Engineering work means both software engineering and systems engineering.

Engineering work is what makes real progress on the project, so it's important that SRE teams always find time to spend on it. 

### Overhead

Any administrative tasks (meetings, OKRs, paperwork) that have to be performed, but are not directly tied to running a service are counted as overhead.

### Toil

See [[Toil]].

At Google they have a rule that every SRE should try to spend at least 50% time on engineering work. If they can't, its a good sign that something must change to allow them to do so.
