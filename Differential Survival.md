Differential survival happens when different organsims of the same species must compete for what they want (reproduction, food, shelter...). It's an important factor in [[Public/Natural Selection]] because it makes only the best fitted organsims pass down their genes to the next generation.

An example of differential survival is when two organisms race towards food, and in the end only the faster one gets to eat.
