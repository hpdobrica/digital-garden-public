When I was working as a developer on the first application that was actually running in production, we relied on looking at the application logs to figure out if something is wrong. We did it for a long time, and we were as proficient in it as one can get. 

I was routinely checking the logs for errors, when I noticed that something is off â€“ in the postmortem, a smart man told me "logs should be the last place you should have to look when faced with an issue like this". This sentence seemed a bit absurd to me at the time â€“ what do you mean, where am I supposed to look instead? Needless to say, back then, I knew nothing about monitoring.

Monitoring is an integral part of running services in production. Without it, we are blind to what's going on, and thus unable to act according to our best interest.

Providing visibility is in the center of monitoring, but speaking more broadly, monitoring allows us to:
- easily debug our systems
- see how a change impacts our system
- implement [[Alerting]] that something is broken or will break soon
- perform long-term trend analysis


In essence, monitoring is collection of events and their contexts (e.g., HTTP request is an event, its full context holds all details about it: url, body, status code...). Ideally, we'd have all events together with their whole contexts. In reality, that's a lot of data, so we need to divide monitoring into four categories based on how we collect the data:
- [[Profiling]]
- [[Tracing]]
- [[Logging]]
- [[Metric Monitoring]]

Somewhat confusingly, its often refered to metric monitoring as just Monitoring
